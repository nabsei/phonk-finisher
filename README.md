# Montagem Finisher

**A one-knob "genre finisher" audio plugin for funk automotivo / phonk producers.**

Drop in a raw 808, kick, or loop, turn the single `Amount` knob, and get a driven,
tonally-shaped, level-matched sound — no mixing knowledge required. Built with
[JUCE](https://juce.com/), ships as VST3 / AU / Standalone on macOS and Windows.

## Why one knob

Most effect plugins hand you five to ten parameters and assume you know how to use
them. Montagem Finisher is built for a specific audience — funk automotivo / phonk
producers who want a sound that already matches the genre, fast — so every
parameter that would normally be exposed (drive, tone, output limiting) is instead
derived from a single `Amount` macro. Turn it up, it gets more "finished."

## Status

Early-stage / actively developed. Signal chain and calibration are still being
tuned against reference material — see [Open items](#open-items) below.

This repository shows the plugin's **architecture**: JUCE plugin wrapper, custom
UI, parameter handling, state save/load. The exact DSP calibration used in the
shipped/tested build (filter topology, envelope-follower time constants, gain
staging tuned against reference audio) is simplified in `Source/FinisherProcessor.cpp`
here — that tuning is the actual product, not open source at this stage.

## Features

- Single macro parameter (`Amount`) driving the whole signal chain
- Custom dark-themed UI: the knob's glow and arc shift from cyan to magenta as
  the effect intensifies, matching the Bumpin Audio catalogue palette
- Denormal-safe processing and parameter smoothing (no zipper noise when
  automating or turning the knob live)
- Builds as **VST3**, **AU** (passes `auval` validation), and a **Standalone** app

## Tech stack

- C++17, [JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) (audio processing + UI)
- CMake + Ninja

## Building

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE.git libs/JUCE
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

On macOS, add `-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64"` to the configure step
to build a universal binary (Apple Silicon + Intel) instead of the host-only
default. The official beta releases are built this way.

This produces a VST3, an AU component, and a standalone app under
`build/MontagemFinisher_artefacts/Release/`, and installs the plugin formats into
your system's plugin folders automatically (`COPY_PLUGIN_AFTER_BUILD`).

      beta requires a one-time manual step on first install)

the architecture shown here (JUCE plugin wrapper, UI, build setup). As
noted above, the DSP calibration used in the actual product is not

## Part of the Montagem chain

Montagem Finisher is one piece of a small family of one-knob plugins for
funk automotivo / phonk production, in signal-chain order:

- [Montagem 808](https://github.com/nabsei/montagem-808) — 808 slide synth (the instrument)
- **Montagem Finisher** (this repo) — drive, tone, loudness
- [Montagem Widener](https://github.com/nabsei/montagem-widener) — stereo width
- [Montagem Punch](https://github.com/nabsei/montagem-punch) — transient shaping

Also from Bumpin Audio: [Yano Log](https://github.com/nabsei/yano-log),
[Yano Finish](https://github.com/nabsei/yano-finish),
[Yano Space](https://github.com/nabsei/yano-space),
[Yano Swing](https://github.com/nabsei/yano-swing) — a one-knob amapiano
log drum synth, finisher, space/width processor, and MIDI groove tool --
and the Delta line for audio engineers, [Delta Zero](https://github.com/nabsei/delta-zero)
(phase-cancellation null-test / difference-checker) and
[Delta Blind](https://github.com/nabsei/delta-blind) (loudness-matched A/B compare).
